I decided against making a job portfolio because I am looking for a paralegal position. With my lack of experience in the field before getting other job experience, there is little for me to include in a job portfolio. Instead, I chose to make a silly fun website about Taylor Swift and Cats. I actually may decide to keep this website after the class has concluded because my friends like it so I am excited to continue to upkeep and add more features. So far my website includes links to the official Taylor Swift shop, an article about what cat breeds are as a Taylor Swift song and I plan on adding some quizzes. I am currently still trying to figure out multiple-choice quizzes that don't have a correct answer because most of the examples I have found just show me how to label answers as wrong. I am not including any CSS stylesheet because, unpopular opinion, I find it easier to put it all together on the same sheet. I would maybe do that if I was more experienced with what each thing does but with my current experience I am still making little mistakes and like it all right in front of me so I can adjust each thing to find the problem.
